Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin during their doctoral studies at Stanford University in California. Collectively, they hold approximately 14% of the company's publicly traded shares and exert control over 56% of its shareholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google underwent a restructuring to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. As the largest subsidiary of Alphabet, Google functions as a holding company for its internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, succeeding Larry Page, who transitioned to the role of CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also assumed the position of CEO of Alphabet.

Since that time, the company has experienced rapid growth, expanding its range of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which lead their respective markets. These offerings address various needs, including email (Gmail), navigation and mapping (Waze, Maps, and Earth), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video conferencing (Meet), smart home devices (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch and Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant and Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued products from Google include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.

Google's additional initiatives beyond internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving vehicles (Waymo, formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).

Google Search and YouTube are ranked as the two most-visited websites worldwide, followed by Facebook and Twitter (now referred to as X). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, online video platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, machine learning framework, and AI virtual assistant provider globally, as evidenced by market share. According to Forbes, Google is ranked second among the most valuable brands, while Interbrand places it fourth. The company has faced significant criticism regarding various issues, including privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust matters, and the abuse of its monopoly power. On August 5, 2024, D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly over internet search.
